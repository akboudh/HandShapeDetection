# HandShapeDetection 
<h1>Hand Feature Extraction</h1>

### [YouTube Demonstration]( https://youtu.be/qTsa4DgnLSw)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves extracting hand features from images using MATLAB. It includes setting points and lines manually on the hand image, calculating perpendicular lines, and comparing feature vectors between different hand images.

Files used:
1. HandFeatureExtraction.m - MATLAB script for hand feature extraction.
2. Hand_1.png, Hand_2.png, Hand_3.png, Hand_4.png, Hand_5.png - Hand images used for feature extraction.
3. assignment_figure.png - Example figure illustrating the hand placement, points, and axes.

Code Sources:
1. MATLAB documentation: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/
2. Image Processing Toolbox documentation: https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/

Instructions:
1. Run the HandFeatureExtraction.m script in MATLAB.
2. Follow the instructions to set points and lines manually on each hand image.
3. The script will calculate the feature vectors for each image and compare them using Euclidean distance.
